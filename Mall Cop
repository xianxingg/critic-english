In fact, this is a really really boring movie, but it does touch me when Paul said this:

> Okay, Divina, listen very intently.
> Some people think that holding on is what makes one strong.
> But in reality, our only power is in letting go.
> > But I love ...
> That's it.
> See, it's easy to fall in love, but hard to find someone to catch you.
> Besides, you don't love me.
> > But I ...
> What you love is the mystery.
> That's all I am to you.
> You know, I'm a lone cowboy.
> A renegade.
> A Rocky Mountain steed.
> But truth be told, Divina, I'm none of those things.
> I'm a simple man.
> Now, the qualities you seek, they're in him.
> That man, sitting right over there.
> That man, just longing to catch.
> He's crying right now, isn't he?
> ...
> ...
> But he's the real deal, Divina.
> He swung in on a rope like a knight in shining armor,
> and he rescued my daughter and me, and he loves you.
> Now, go to him.
