### Sense8 is the best show of 2015. 
by AtheistComic
> I've been reading a lot of negative reviews around the web about Sense8 and it seems to me that the typical reviewer crowd were all betting that the wachowskis exploration of LGBT material in explicit detail would cause a lot of mainstream viewers to be disgusted by the show. Those [prejudiced](#prejudice) against LGBT are therefore unable to make an objective review and that's pretty much why the critics gave it around a 66% on rottentomatoes, while the audience is scoring it around a 90% level.

> I don't think I've seen in my life a show with more heart and love of the human condition than Sense8. The passion these characters have towards one another is [intimate](#intimate) and naked. The chemistry between the actors is at least as good as the first Matrix. I can't find any weak links in the cast at all -- each performance continually built and felt well grounded with foundation of personal history that was Shakespearean tragic in most of their stories. Now that I think of it I don't think any of them had a perfect history... it was all quite human.

> I can't remember [weaping](#weeping) as often as I did through this series while watching anything else except maybe Breaking Bad although BB didn't connect as much for me as Sense8 did, which I would think could have something to do with the criminal nature of BB -- much of the time I felt Walter White deserved much of what happened. The fragility of human life though as [portrayed](#portray) in Sense8 touched a deep nerve in my psyche... I think this fucking show changed me.

> I'd like to ask for seven more seasons that continue this journey in the same [intensity](#intensity) because there is something beautiful here that isn't anywhere near played out.

> This show was also life-changing for me, it was so deeply [cerebral](#cerebral) and diverse in character stories... It make the "connections" so [tangible](#tangible) on the screen. It was heart [wrenching](#wrench) and yet so hard to turn away. This is quite honestly some of the best cinematic scenes I've witnessed on a LONG time...!

> It's certainly the most unique. The characters are, [across the board](#across-the-board), the most human of any television show i've ever seen. Which i think is entirely the point.
